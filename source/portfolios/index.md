![INSIDE](/images/mbe-1.png)
>### Core value
>- Before the delivery of this application, the company can only handle 300 tons of cargo per day, with 110+ people. Every day of the company is chaos, full of shouting in phones and all kinds of IM. After, 1000 tons per day is also easy to handle, everything is operating smoothly with their workflow.
>- Every operation of cargo is recorded in the application, and related charges are generated and calculated automatically. The realtime profit of the company, even of every order is easy to trace. No error made by human is avoided to an extreme.

>### Core value
>- Make communication between the airline company and consignor much easier, faster and smoother. Every shipping space state of every flight is available to check online, every cargo routine detail is easy to trace in realtime.
>- Shipping space arrangement can never be so easy and intelligent. The airline shipping space manager doesn't need to calculate space allocation anymore. The application can do that job much faster and more accurate, using the realtime booking data from consignor and shipping data from the airline. 
>- Precise marketing becomes possible. It all benefited from history booking data analysis and booking trend prediction engine.
